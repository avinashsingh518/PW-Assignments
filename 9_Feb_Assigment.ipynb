It can be described as a process where the child class or object inherits the methods and attributes from one or more parent classes. It is a hierarchical process that leads to reusability of a code, higher performance and flexibility.\n",

    "Ans:- Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.   \n",
